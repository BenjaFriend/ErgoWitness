# Things that I found helpful

First off, huge shoutout to my friend Ben Bornholm and his [blog](https://holdmybeer.xyz/) with a guide to the ELK stack. [This post](https://holdmybeer.xyz/2017/01/24/intro-to-the-elk-stack-on-centos-7/) in particular was very helpful. 

## Guides

Here is a list of guides that really helped me get a good understanding of the ELK stack and CentOS in general.
